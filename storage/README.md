## Description </a>
It makes read me based on terminal inputs Here's how things broke for Commander Masters...

Total number of commanders: 8
Total number of commander decks: 35,641
Average commander deck count: 4,455
Most decks: Zhulodok, Void Gorger
 (12,613 decks)
Fewest decks: Leori, Sparktouched Hunter
 (882 decks)
We usually get upwards of 30 commander per set these days, if not far more, so eight is a paltry sum. That said, the average is far higher than any set over the past year. In other words, there weren't many commanders, but of the few we got, they were impactful.

That shouldn't come as a surprise, considering this was a set with the format's title in the title. Furthermore, the product came exclusively in pre-constructed commander decks, which are often the most popular mode of distribution for EDH players. Plus, not only were the commanders sweetâ€”so were the decks themselves. I mean, just check out some of the other cards unique to this product:

Rise of the Eldrazi
Darksteel Monolith
Flayer of Loyalties
Ondu Spiritdancer
Composer of Spring
Titan of Littjara

AD
You've probably seen some, if not all, of these cards at your local tables this past year. They're popular selections in their own rights, and yet another reason these commanders fared so favorably. There were even several exclusive planeswalkers, including a new Chandra (Chandra, Legacy of Fire
) and a guy I assumed was a D&D character (Vronos, Masked Inquisitor
). All that contributes to one bigtime product.

But that wasn't always obvious. Even at debut, these decks were highly sought-after and therefore pretty pricey, by which I mean, really pricey. The Eldrazi and Sliver decks in particular started at well over $100, leading many players to wonder if that might affect this crop's popularity.

Clearly, it didn't, which is a good takeaway moving forward. Many players likely just bought the commanders as singles (all but Zhulodok are highly affordable), while some others probably theory-crafted lists even without the cards. And for those who bought the decks, 99 and all, I salute you.

Now for some commander-by-commander analysis.
